        <h2>Quick Definitions</h2>

        <h3>What is implicit bias?</h3>
        <p>
          Implicit bias is when we have automatic assumptions or associations that can influence our decisions,
          even if we don't consciously agree with those assumptions. It often reflects patterns absorbed from culture,
          media, and history.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the IBT / IAT?</h3>
        <p>
          The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a timed activity that measures how quickly you sort things into categories.
          Because it's time-pressured, it can reveal fast associations rather than careful, intentional beliefs.
        </p>

        <h3>What is intersectionality?</h3>
        <p>
          Intersectionality is the idea that people don't experience the world through one identity at a time. Race, gender,
          class, nationality, religion (and more) overlap, and that overlap can shape how someone is treated or perceived.
        </p>

        <!-- reflections section without showing specific scores/results -->
        <h2>Our Thoughts on the Bias Test (no results)</h2>
        <p>
          We took the Asian American vs. European American version of the test, and one of the biggest things we noticed
          was how fast-paced it felt. The time pressure made it stressful, and there was almost no time to stop and think.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of that, our reactions didn't feel intentional or carefully considered. It felt less like a judgment of
          personal values and more like a reflection tool showing how bias can operate beneath the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also thought about intersectionality: the test isolates one identity, but real life is more complex. People's
          experiences depend on overlapping identities and context.
        </p>
        <p>
          This matters in technology too. If systems are built using biased data or limited perspectives, they can reinforce
          inequalities — especially when intersectional identities aren't considered.

        <h3>Quick tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pause before decisions when you can (slows automatic thinking).</li>
          <li>Seek diverse sources and perspectives.</li>
          <li>Design tech with accessibility + inclusion in mind.</li>
